      <p>Hi Mr. Customer,</p>
    <br></br>
      <p>Trust you are well.</p>
    <br></br>
      <p>Please find my response to your query below:</p>
    <br></br>
      <p>
        You have the ability to redirect the <code>/blog</code> path of your main application to a different website by utilizing the <code>rewrites()</code> function in your <code>next.config.js</code> file. Hereâ€™s an example how to do this:
      </p>
      <pre>
        module.exports = {'{'}
        <br /> &nbsp; async rewrites() {'{'}
        <br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; return [
        <br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {'{'}
        <br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; source: '/blog',
        <br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; destination: 'https://example.com/blog',
        <br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {'}'},
        <br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {'{'}
        <br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; source: '/blog/:vercel',
        <br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; destination: 'https://example.com/blog/:vercel', // Matched parameters can be used in the destination
        <br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {'}'},
        <br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; ];
        <br /> &nbsp; {'}'},
        <br /> {'}'}
      </pre>
    <br></br>
      <p>
        In this example, when a request is made to <code>/blog</code> on your main app, it will be redirected to the specified URL of the external website. Likewise, a request to <code>/blog/:vercel</code> (where <code>:vercel</code> represents any value) will also be redirected accordingly to the external website's URL.
      </p>
