    <p>6. A customer is just getting started with Vercel and has questions about
recommended options for third-party integrations for Monitoring or Logging.
Knowing that:
a. Vercel has in-house observability products,
b. Vercel likes to guide on processes, but
c. Vercel doesn&rsquo;t like to steer customers towards one solution or another, but
demonstrates what the product can do.
How would you respond to the customer?
    </p>
    <br></br>
     <p>Hi Mr. Customer,</p>
   <br></br>
      <p>Thanks for reaching out. I hope you have had a good experience so far with us.</p>
   <br></br>
      <p>I would gladly suggest you a few 3rd party integration options as requested. However, I would like to highlight that at Vercel we have our own in-house Frontend Observability, which has been trusted by leading companies like The Washington Post, Stripe, Neo, Runway, eBay, Upstart, Notion, and many others. This has been carefully prepared to meet the real needs of the customers and provide them with the best features.</p>
